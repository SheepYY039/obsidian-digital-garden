# Narrowing Conversion

> [!note]
> A narrowing conversion changes a value to a data type that might not be able to hold some of the possible values
> 
> Fitting a larger sized variable into a smaller sized type.

> [!info]
> C++ uses **truncation** rather than **rounding** in converting a `float`|`double` to `short`|`int`|`long`

## Compiling

> [!warning]
> 
> [file].cpp:[line]: **warning**: converting to '`<target type>`' from '`<original type>`'
