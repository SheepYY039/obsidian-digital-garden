## Why People Persuade

> [!quote] Andrew Sayer, 2011
> The most important questions people tend to face in their lives are normatives ones of what is good or bad about what is happening, including *how others are treating them*, and of course *how to act* and *what to do for the best*.

> 人們在生活中所面對的最重要的問題往往是那些和好與壞有關的規範性問題，包括*別人是如何對待它們的*，當然還有*如何去應對*，以及*做什麼事才是最好的問題*。
