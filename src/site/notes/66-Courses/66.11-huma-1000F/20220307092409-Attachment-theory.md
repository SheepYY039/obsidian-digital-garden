# Attachment Theory

## John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth

- Infant’s attachment with their parents and caregivers

## Cindy Hazan and Philip Shaver (1987)

**Apply Bowlby and Ainsworth’s theory on adults**

- Both feel safe when the other is nearby and responsive
- Both engage in close, intimate, bodily contact,
- Both feel insecure when the other is inaccessible
- Both share discoveries with one another
- Both play with one another’s facial features and exhibit a mutual fascination and preoccupation with one another
- Both engage in “Baby talk”
