  - Failure to take responsibility …
- Failure to guard against unethical and illegal practices
  - Does not excuse them from their duty to impose proper controls
  - As they have to shoulder the responsibility for any slippage in the work.

## Engineers Involved

- Can’t be the act of a few rogue engineers
- The implications go all the way up the corporate ladder

> We see how widespread among the product line this device was. It would have had to be tested and updated. This is serious, massive coporate maleficience that affects people’s health. There’s no question that everyone involved knew this was unethical.

- Importance of environmental safety, even when it is less efficient or economical

- May have been the company culture

- If no one in management is rejecting unethical acts

- Engineers should say no

- But engineers will have to be willing to leave the company

- You adhere to a code of professional conduct as a licensed engineer, which includes reporting situations where conduct could be illegal, and not to engage in activities that violates the law

- Suggests that when facing moral situations, reach out to others you trust. The more people you can collaborate with, the better you can handle the situation

- VW “corruptly alter, destry, mutilate and conceal budiness records” in an effort the disrupt the investigation

- With increased use of electronics in cars, ethical situations like this will become even more common in the future. Therefore, new regulatory and standardized “ethics in engineering” might be the controller for such process.

## Ethical Implication Questions

1. What are ethical issues in question? How significant are these issues in the engineering profession?
2. What did the engineers do/ fail to do? Why was it hard for the engineers concerned to decide on what to do? Were they involved in a dilemma?
3. What rules of engineering ethics were relevant to the situation? Were there rules of obligation that conflicted with each other?
4. Different options are open to the (groups of) engineers? What would be the outcomes of these actions on different parties (e.g. the public, the company, the profession, the engineers themselves, etc.)?
