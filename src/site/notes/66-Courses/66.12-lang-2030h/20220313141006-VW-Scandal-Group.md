# VW Scandal Group

## Notes

1. Engineers face tremendous amounts of pressure to comply with corporate demands
2. Numerous instances where engineers decided to forgo their social responsibility in favour of business demands → Severe consequences for the public

## Background

1. 2015
2. Installed software to cheat emissions tests (in 11 million of their diesel cards) → produce 40 times more NOx on road

## Cause

1. Financial motivations
   1. to increase sales (compete with other automobile competitors)
   2. EA189 Engine (US Market)
      1. Environmentally clean
      2. Economically viable engine
      3. Problem: Trade-off between performance and pollution
      4. Problem: Engineers struggled to limit emissions under standards
      5. Comply with US Standards → Emissions equipment would wear out too quickly
      6. Executives reject proposals (due to high cost)
      7. Solution: Cheat Software -- Detect test + adjust emissions
      8. Implemented: 2006
      9. Uncovered: 2015 by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
         1. Violation of “Clean Air Act”
2. Company culture
   1. “Authoritarian Style” → management fostered a culture of pressure and fear
   2. Pressure on Employees (meet management demands) → “culture of tolerance for rule-breaking”
   3. Dissent and Discussions were limited from employees.
   4. Employees
      1. were told to remain silent
      2. were encouraged not to come out with dissenting options

## Ethics

1. Failure to report software to relevant authorities to protect the public and the environment
   1. ACM 1.04 → Engineers should disclose potential dangers
      1. Bosch + VW engineers would have known
   2. WFEO 1.1 → Refrain from corrupt or criminal acts + report unethical engineers acts (protect public)
   3. All engineers had responsibility to report the malpractice
2. Failure of Engineers to protect safety of public + health of the environment
   1. Didn’t report issues
      1. emissions test conducted in the EU did not reflect real-world driving conditions + allowed flexibilities that increase the gap between lab fig. and real-world emissions fig.
      2. no checks for defeat devices
      3. etc.
   2. Failed to listen to warnings given by EU’s environment department.
