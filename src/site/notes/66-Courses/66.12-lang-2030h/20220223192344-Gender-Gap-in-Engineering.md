# Gender Gap in Engineering

## 1 to 2 Minute Presentation

The gender gap in Engineering is acceptable

Gender gap shouldn't exist in the field of engineering. One of the focus of engineering is the creation of products that benefits the human society. Since the mind and view of the society is different from everyone's eye, it is beneficial to the filed if we have a more diversified team of engineers contributing.

In addition to that point, I also believe that our current problem is trying to label specific jobs or areas as jobs for a specific gender.
