# National Commission on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling – Chief Counsel Final Report [Extract]

The full report by the National Commission on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling examines in depth the history and current status of Minerals Management Service (MMS) regulatory programs, and makes specific recommendations for regulatory reform.

## MMS Background

MMS, now the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, ==employs approximately 600 individuals to run operations in the Gulf of Mexico region==. About one-fifth of that staff is distributed among five district operations offices. Each district office has a small cadre of engineers, including drilling engineers. ==Drilling engineers review drilling permit applications==.

The MMS office that supervised drilling in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 ==had one designated drilling engineer for the review of permits==. **That individual thus reviewed several hundred permits each year and approved BP‘s initial application for a permit to drill (APD) a well** at Macondo, as well as subsequent applications modifying that permit.

> [!note]
> Work overload may lead to misapproval of permits.

## Findings

The Commission finds that:

- MMS had a ==built-in financial incentive to promote offshore drilling== that was in tension with its mandate to ensure safe drilling and environmental protection;

- ==revenue increases dependent on deepwater drilling came with increased safety and environmental risks==, but those risks were not matched by greater, more sophisticated regulatory oversight;

- MMS was ==unable to maintain up-to-date technical drilling-safety requirements to keep up with industry‘s rapidly evolving deepwater technology==. As drilling technology evolved, many aspects of drilling lacked corresponding safety regulations; and

- at the time of the blowout, MMS ==systematically lacked the resources, technical training, or experience in petroleum engineering== that is critical to ensuring that offshore drilling is being conducted in a safe and responsible manner.

> [!note]
> MMS conducted offshore drilling with the incentive of revenue increases, despite increased safety and environmental risks, lack of up-to-date knowledge about technical drilling-safety requirements, and experience in petroleum engineering.

## Summary

MMS approved the permit and conducted offshore drilling with the incentive of revenue increases, despite increased safety and environmental risks, lack of up-to-date knowledge about technical drilling-safety requirements, and experience in petroleum engineering.
