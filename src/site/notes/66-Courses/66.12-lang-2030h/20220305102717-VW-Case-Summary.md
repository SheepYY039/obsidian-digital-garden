# VW Case Summary

- VW cheated on emissions testing by using a “defeat device” software to detect emission tests. Emission Controls were then implemented to reduce the amount of Nitrogen Oxides to the allowed level. Without such alterations, the diesel cars will spew up to 40 times over the limit.
