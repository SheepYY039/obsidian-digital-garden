# Cooperative Cheating

## Caused by

- Silence of employees when a company is committing a crime
- Organisational deceptions
  - encourage the employees who feel uncomfortable to cheat to leave
  - leaving two types of employees behind
    - Those who feel comfortable with dishonest acts
    - Those who decided to continue contributing despite being uncomfortable
- Years later of committing the crime
  - All employees cultivate a climate of fear
    - The project will be exposed
    - Then put them into a lawsuit
  - Thus No employees will be willing to blow the whistle
