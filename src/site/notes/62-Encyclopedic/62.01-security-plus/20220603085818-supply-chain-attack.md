# Supply Chain Attack

>[!word] Supply Chain Attack
> 一個生產線有很多部分：
> 1. 原材料
> 2. 供應商
> 3. 工廠
> 4. 批發
> 5. 商戶
> 6. 顧客
> 7. 用戶
> 
> 攻擊者完全可以 infect different parts in along the way，因爲用戶大多相信生產過程，也不會懷疑。一個 exploit 就可以感染整條生產連。

>[!example] Supply chain attack 
> Target Corp. breach - November 2013 
> - 40 million credit cards stolen 
> 
> Heating and AC firm in Pennsylvania was infected 
> - [[62-Encyclopedic/20220516095203-malware|Malware]] delivered through email 
> - VPN credentials for HVAC techs were stolen
> - Since this Heating and AC firm uses a VPN to communicate with the infected companies 
> 
> HVAC vendor was the supplier 
> - Attackers used a wide-open Target network to infect every cash register at 1,800 stores
