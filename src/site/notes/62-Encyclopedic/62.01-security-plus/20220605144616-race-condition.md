> **Starting Account Values**
> - *Account A* = \$100
> - *Account B* = \$100
> 
> **Purposes**
> - *User 1* transfers \$50 from *Account A* to *Account B*
> - *User 2* transfers \$50 from *Account A* to *Account B*
> 
> 1. *User 1* checks balance  
>     1. *Account A* = \$100

>     1. *Account A* = \$100
>     2. *Account B* += \$50 = \$200

>     1. *Account A* -= \$50 = \$50
>     2. *Account B* = \$200 
> 3. *User 2* removes \$50 from *Account A* 
>     1. *Account A* -= \$50 = \$50 
>         1. Did not check account balance, and still thinks that *Account A* has \$100
>     2. *Account B* = \$200

> **Mars rover "Spirit"** - January 2004

> - It found a problem with a file system, then it reboot itself because of it 
> - But found that the file system corrupted during the reboot process 
> - So it rebooted itself again 
> - Then a reboot loop was resulted 
> 
> Finally, then asked the rover to reboot into safe mode, and fixed the file system, then rebooted it again.

> [!example] Race Condition 
> **Therac-25 radiation therapy machine** - 1980s

> - Software interlocks failed  
> - Race condition caused 100 times the normal dose of radiation 
> - Six patients injured, three deaths
