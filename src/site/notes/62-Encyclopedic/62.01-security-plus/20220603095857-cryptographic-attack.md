# Cryptographic Attack

- You've encrypted data and sent it to another person 
	- is it really secure?
	- How do you know? 
- The bad guy doesn't have the combination (the key) 
	- So they break the safe (the [[62-Encyclopedic/20220319080532-cryptography|cryptography]])
- Attackers use a lot of time finding ways to undo the security 
	- There are many potential cryptographic shortcomings 
	- The problem is often the implementation
