# Cloud-based or On-premises Storage

>[!note] Cloud-based or On-premises storage
> There are two categories for IT security: 
> 1. "The on-premises data is more secure! "
> 2. "The cloud-based data is more secure!" 

| Cloud-based                      | On-premises               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| no dedicated hardware            | Security burden on client |
| no data center to secure         | data center security      |
| a third-party handles everything | infrastructure costs      |
| centralized                      |                           |
| costs less                       |                           |
