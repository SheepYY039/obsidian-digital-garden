# MAC Cloning

>[!word] MAC Cloning
> An attacker changes their [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605180300-media-access-control-address|MAC Address]] to match the [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605180300-media-access-control-address|MAC Address]] of an existing device. 
> - [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605180300-media-access-control-address|MAC Address]] Filters inside of a Wireless AP 
>     - Attacker may check and match an existing allow list 
>     - So attacker can gain access to a network that they would normally not 
> - Can also Create a DoS 
>     - by distrupting communication to the legitimate Device 
>     - The switch will switch back and forth and back and forth between where this [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605180300-media-access-control-address|MAC address]] might be on the network 
>     - The switch may send all data to the attacker instead of the legitimate user 
> 
> Fortunately, most switches include features that will look for, and block MAC Cloning.
