> 3. *Process B* copies [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220603134318-dynamic-link-library|DLL]] to *Process A*
> 4. *Process A* executes [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220603134318-dynamic-link-library|DLL]] as a new thread runing as *Process A*
>     1. So [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220603134318-dynamic-link-library|DLL]] can be run with capabilities and rights of *Process A* which *Process B* does not have
