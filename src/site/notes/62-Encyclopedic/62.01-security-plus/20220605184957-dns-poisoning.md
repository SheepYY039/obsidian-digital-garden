# DNS Poisoning

>[!word] DNS Poisoning
> Requires some knowledge to do a DNS Poisoning Attack by modifying the DNS Server, but it is an effective method to redirect traffic to an attacker's website. 

## Ways to Poison DNS

- Modify the Client Host File
	- The host file takes precedent over DNS queries 
- Send a fake response to a valid DNS Request 
	- Requires a redirection of the original request or the resulting response 
	- Requries [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605173141-on-path-network-attack|On-path attack]]
- Modify the DNS Server itself
