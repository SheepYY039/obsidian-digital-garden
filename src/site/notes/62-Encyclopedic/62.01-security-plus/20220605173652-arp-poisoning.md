# ARP Poisoning

>[!word] ARP Poisoning
> An [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605173141-on-path-network-attack|on-path attack]] on the local IP subnet. 
> - [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605173808-address-resolution-protocol|ARP]] has no security. 
> - Devices receive and modify [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605173808-address-resolution-protocol|ARP]] tables without requiring any [[62-Encyclopedic/20220319080626-authentication|authentication]] or [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220602130052-encryption|encryption]] 
> - Allows attackers to send any types of [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605173808-address-resolution-protocol|ARP]] to any devices on the local subnet, and the local devices will interpret the [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605173808-address-resolution-protocol|ARP]] as if it was from a legitimate source 

> [!example] ARP Poisoning Process 
> **Actors** 
> - *Laptop* 
>     - *IP*: `192.168.1.9`
>     - *MAC*: `c8:bc:c8:a7:38:d5`
> - *Router*
>     - *IP*: `192.168.1.1`
>     - *MAC*: `00:09:5b:d4:bb:fe`
> - *Attacker*
>     - *IP*: `192.168.1.14`
>     - *MAC*: `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`
> 
> **Scene 1** - *Laptop* Address Resolution
> 1. *Laptop* - Who is `192.168.1.1`?
> 2. *Router* - I am `192.168.1.1`! My *MAC* is `00:09:5b:d4:bb:fe`.
> 3. *Laptop*
>     1. Stores `192.168.1.1=00:09:5b:d4:bb:fe` in **ARP Cache**
> 
> **Scene 2** - *Attacker* ARP Poisoning 
> 1. *Attacker* -> *Laptop* - I am `192.168.1.1`. My *MAC* is `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`
> 2. *Laptop*
>     1. Receives the information 
>     2. [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605173808-address-resolution-protocol|ARP]] does not have [[62-Encyclopedic/20220319080626-authentication|authentication]] or [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220602130052-encryption|encryption]] 
>     3. *Laptop* thinks its from legitimate source
>     4. Stores `192.168.1.1=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff` in **ARP Cache**
> 3. â€¦*Attacker* does the same thing on *Router*
> 
> Next time *Laptop* sends anything to *Router*, the information will be sent to *Attacker* instead 

## On-path Browser Attack

- The middleman was on the same computer as the victim 
	- instead of human, [[62-Encyclopedic/20220516095203-malware|Malware]] or [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220602143703-trojan|Trojan]] does all the proxy work
- Huge advantages for the attackers 
	- Relatively #easy to proxy encrypted traffic 
	- Everything looks normal to the victim 
- [[62-Encyclopedic/20220516095203-malware|Malware]] in your browser waits for you to login to your bank 
	- Capture keystrokes 
	- capture login credentials  
	- then it transfers all information away from your account
		- Sending your money to another account 
		- changing your account credentials 
	- as it can grab all of that raw from your machine
