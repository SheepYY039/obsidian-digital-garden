# SSL Stripping

>[!word] SSL Stripping #attack
> A combination of an on-path attack and a [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220603101024-downgrade-attack|downgrade attack]].
> - Difficult to implement, but big returns for the attacker  
> 
> 身處在 HTTPS 溝通中間，然後攻擊者就改變 victim 和 web server 中間溝通的數據。 
> - 怎麽 sit in the middle?
>     - Proxy Server 
>     - ARP Spoofing 
>     - Rogue Wi-Fi Hotspot 
>     - etc.
> Victim does not see any significant problem
> - The browser page is not encrypted 
> - No more HTTPS communication, the website will show HTTP

## How to Prevent SSL Stripping?

1. This is a client and [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223525-server|server]] problem
	1. Works on [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605142819-secure-sockets-layer|SSL]] and [[62-Encyclopedic/62.01-security-plus/20220605142819-secure-sockets-layer|TLS]] 
	2. Upgrade and maintain software on both client and server side
