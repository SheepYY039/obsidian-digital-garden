- Tamper with the underlying infrastructure or manufacturing process 
	- Should know where each part of the supply chain comes from 
	- And understand the attack vectors of all of them 

> [!example] Supply chain attack vectors 
> - Gain access to a network using a vendor 
>     - 2013 target credit card breach  
> - Attackers use a third-party to target 
>     - when the attacker has access to the target network 
>     - they effectively has access to all cash registers at every target location

> - Malware can modify the manufacturing process 
> - 2010 - Stuxnet disrupts Iran's uranium enrichment program 

> [!example] Supply chain attack vectors 
> - counterfeit networking equipment 
>     - install backdoors, substandard performance and availability 
> - 2020 - Fake Cisco Catalyst 2960-X and WS-2960X-48TS-L
>     - These models did not originate from Cisco
