# Social Engineering Principles

1. Authority
   1. The social engineer is in charge
   2. "I'm calling from the help desk/office of the CEO/police"
2. Intimidation
   1. 你不帮助就会有坏事发生
   2. “If you don't help me, the payroll checks won't be processed”
3. Consensus/ Social Proof
   1. Convince based on what's normally expected
   2. "Your co-worker Jill did this for me last week"
4. Scarcity
   1. 时间一直倒数着～
   2. Must make the change before time expires
5. Urgency
   1. Works with scarcity
   2. 让你觉得没时间想了，要快点行动
6. Familiarity/ Liking
   1. 爱屋及乌
   2. Someone you know, we have common friends
7. Trust
   1. Someone who is safe
   2. I'm from IT, and I'm here to help
