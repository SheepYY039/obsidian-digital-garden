## CERAnalysis

- Understand the scope of the data breach -> know what I should be respoding to
- Includes
  - How many computers are affected
  - What services are affected
  - type of malware
  - what indicators of compromise (IOCs) are available

## Containment

- Taking actions
  - isolate affected machines
  - disconnecting them from internet
  - disconnecting them from the company's network

> [!danger]
> Do not power off the machines as you will lose valuable evidence that you need in later steps
>
> - Only remove internet access
> - disconnect from company's network and all other corporate devices

## Eradication

- Remove any trace of infection from the affected systems
- fix the vulnerability on those machines that allowed for the infection
  - To ensure that these computers can be put back into use
  - Includes:
  - Remove malware
  - reset [[62-Encyclopedic/20220319080333-passwords|passwords]] that were compromised
  - adding [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318214141-multi-factor-authentication|Multi-factor Authentication]]
  - Patching Vulnerable software
- The goal
  - Have clean adn secure systems that the business can use again

> [!note]
> The best way is to reimage the machine using a trusted image.
> This simply means wiping the computer of all data and software and then reinstalling the software back into the machine.

## Recovery

- Restore the services and accounts that were lost because of the data breach.
- Actions to take
  - Reconnect all services, desktops, applications back to the network for regular use
  - Re-enable disabled accounts after resetting and improving login information
