# Cloud Computing Deployment Models

## Cloud

- All parts of your application will be running in the cloud
- applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure
- To take advantage of the [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318222441-benefits-of-cloud-computing|benefits of cloud computing]], your applications can then be built on low-level infrastructure pieces, or you can use higher level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of your core infrastructure.

## Hybrid

- Deployment is such a way that to connect your existing infrastructure and applications to a cloud-based resources.
- They are not located in the cloud
- They are located in your physical facilities
- extends and grow your implementation while connecting cloud resources to your internal systems

## On-premises (Private Cloud)

- Deploying resources on-premises use virtualization and resource management tools, sometimes called private cloud.
- While on-premises deployment does not provide many of the benefits of [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223248-cloud-computing|cloud computing]], it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources
