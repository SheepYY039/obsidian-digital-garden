# Cloud Troubleshooting

## Step 1 — Understand the User Problem

Listen to the user or critically read the user’s notice.

- What exactly is going on?
- Which part of the cloud system is experiencing an issue?

## Step 2 — Check Your Cloud Dashboard

- Is a specific app or [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223525-server|server]] down?
- Is everything up and running on the cloud’s side?

If the dashboard reveals a problem with an app, notify the developer.

If the [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223525-server|server]] is down, notify the cloud provider.

If your dashboard is green, the user is on the user’s end, and you will have to start troubleshooting their system.

## Step 3 — Troubleshoot the User’s System

One at a time, guide the user through these steps

1. Restart the app or browser
2. Restart the Wi-Fi the device is using
3. Restart the device


## Step 4 — Refer the User to Device Tech Support

Still experiencing issues? Send the user to technical support for the specific device.
