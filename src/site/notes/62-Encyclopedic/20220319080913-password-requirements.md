# Password Requirements

## Number of Characters

> [!example]
> Must be a minimum of 8 characters

- Longer [[62-Encyclopedic/20220319080333-passwords|Passwords]] are more difficult to crack than shorter ones.

## Combination of Different Character Classes

> [!example]
>
> - Must contain at lease one uppercase and one lower case letter.
> - Must contain at least 1 digit (0-9) and one symbol (~\`!@#$%^&\*\(\)+=\_-{}[]\\|:;\"\'?/<>,.)

Using uppercase and lowercase letters double the number of choices from 26 to 52 letters.

Adding digits and symbols adds complexity beyond alphabetical characters alone.

## Strings to Prevent Including

> [!example]
> Must Not Contain a Proper Name, Login Id, or First or Last Name

- This keeps a password unique compared to other user accounts.
