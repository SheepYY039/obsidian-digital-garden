# Benefits of Cloud Computing

**In General**

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
   1. Data centre investment based on forecast
   2. Pay only for the amount you consume
2. Massive economies of scale
   1. Lower Variable Cost in the cloud
3. Stop Guessing Capacity
   1. Unlike in server rooms, there will not be
   1. Overestimated server capacity
   1. Underestimated Server Capacity
   1. As there is **scaling on demand**
4. Increase speed and agility
   1. New information technology is just a click away
   2. reduce the time it takes to make new resources available
   3. Weeks →Minutes
   4. Cost and time it takes to experiment and develop are significantly lower
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centres
   1. Focus on projects instead of on the infrastructure
   2. Focus on customers
6. Go global in minutes
   1. Can deploy application in multiple AWS regions around the world with just a few clicks
   2. Lower latency and better experience for your customers simply and at a minimal cost

## 1 Immediate Access

**Immediate Access** to a large amount of data

1. Developers can have immediate access to much more data stored in larger servers without needing a large computer or a server room.
2. [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223248-cloud-computing|Cloud Computing]] servers pull and store large amounts of data from multiple sites.

## 2 More Storage Space

1. As your storage needs increase, you can more easily increase your **storage in the cloud** than you can on a computer.
2. Cloud Servers let users and developers see user traffic data, including
   1. where in the world people are
   2. times of day
   3. What they view
   4. for how long
3. Developers and companies use cloud computing
   1. to analyse all this data
   2. determine improvements to current sites or products,
   3. create new sites or products, and
   4. add new features that users will like and use

## 3 Scale

[[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223248-cloud-computing|Cloud Computing]] systems are wide reaching.

- Systems such as AWS give you the flexibility to reach a large audience for a lower cost.

## 4 Agility

You can try new features for your applications quickly and easily with [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223248-cloud-computing|cloud computing]] systems.

- Simply click a button to add a feature, take a feature away, and share your changes with users around the world.

## 5 Global Access

[[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223248-cloud-computing|Cloud Computing]] systems allow you to share your apps around the world with the simple click of a button.

## 6 Flexible Infrastructure (Cost)

[[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223248-cloud-computing|Cloud Computing]] allows users to access and pay for technology resources like a utility, and [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223248-cloud-computing|cloud computing]] systems can be expanded easily at a lower cost.

- No more purchasing an extra computer, backup memory drive, or flash drive.
- **[[62-Encyclopedic/20220520125934-pay-as-you-go|Pay-as-you-go]]** — [[62-Encyclopedic/20220318223248-cloud-computing|Cloud Computing]] services like AWS do not force users into long-term contracts.
  - Pay for as much storage and speed as you need
  - When you need it, and upgrade or downgrade with a simple click of a button — Anytime, Anywhere.

## 7 Speed

Fast server speeds cost more but also allow more people to access your digital items faster, with little frustration.

## 8 Flexible Coding

Systems like AWS speak multiple coding languages, allowing AWS to work with any other Internet System from around the world.
