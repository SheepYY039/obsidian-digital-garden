# Multi-factor Authentication

> [!word] Multi-factor Authentication
> MFA is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of your username and password.

- With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an account
  - **First Factor** — They will be prompted for their username and password
  - **Second Factor** — They will be prompted for an authentication code from their device

## MFA Authentication Code

Because the code is generated locally on your device, a remote attacker would need to gain escalated privileges on your device as well as have your username and password.
