# Ethical Dilemmas for Engineers in the Development of Autonomous Systems

## Abstract

The development of ethical autonomous systems requires that engineers determine the publicly acceptable actions and decisions of these systems. And yet, recent cases show that engineers working for large organizations do not always act for the public good or the benefit of society. Ethics are often presented as objective social and legal norms, rather than a complicated series of constraints and expectations, determined from multiple sources. Engineers are forced to navigate the expectations of the numerous groups of which they are members, including the organizations and industries that they work for, the engineering profession, regulators, and society in general. These expectations can come into conflict. Engineers are then expected to determine whose values and standards take precedence. Unfortunately, as the results of this study show, engineers rarely explicitly consider the ethical or social implications of the technologies that they are developing.

## Notes

**Extracted Annotations (05/03/2022, 14:45:36)**

"The recent Volkswagen diesel scandal is an example of the conflict between internal organizational culture and norms and external regulatory and societal norms." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=2))

"Once the formal investigation began in the fall of 2015, more than 50 employees acknowledged that they knew of the technical deception [18]. They also reported contributing characteristics of VW's organizational climate: engineers acting against the norms and standards of the organization risked being ostracized from their peers and denied the rewards for performance." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=2))

"This suggests that the engineers who developed the software were following cultural norms and personal drives for salary, esteem, and so forth and must have believed that it was in the organization's interests to develop it." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=2))

"However, to have done it anyway meant that they must have thought that it was acceptable and desired within the limits and culture of VW [16]." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=2))

"Doing something that was illegal did not cause the engineers at VW to report the illegal activities to regulators. Rather, when confronted with the deception, they worked to obfuscate and cover it up, even accusing regulators of faulty data and technical errors [16]." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=2))

"That is, the actions of engineers at VW indicate that they did not think that developing the technology, deploying it, and then lying about it was unethical, despite knowing that this was illegal." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=2))

"Engineers are expected to ensure public safety and protect the public good as the paramount values of the profession." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=2))

"that organizational directions and goals align with the public interest, may be faulty." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=3))

"those standards within their designs." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=3))

"These codes of professional conduct offer little in the way of techniques for discerning and operationalizing the "public good". They also presume that engineers can evaluate, and then balance successfully, the directives of their employers and their own actions relative to the relatively ambiguous concept of a "public good"." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=3))

"When an individual engineer estimates that the public good conflicts with organizational goals and directives, engineers are expected to refuse to assist the organization in meeting those goals. This requires that engineers act against the directives of the organization in which they are a member - the very organization that help to frame the social norms and ethical framework in which the engineer operates." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=3))

"Going rogue, however, is costly: developing technological solutions that support organizational goals makes an engineer a team player, focused on helping the organization to be successful. This is what is typically expected from engineersâ€¦.except when it is not." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=3))

"This analysis suggests that engineers are left to approach the development of technologies without guidelines or peerlevel concerns for the ethical or social implications of the technologies." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=5))

"However, engineers do not necessarily have the ability to independently discern what is ethical or not. Engineers exist within networks and their ethics are a function of their networks, organizations, and interactions [28]." ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=5))

"If engineers are to objectively determine the public good (or public evil) of their work, then better tools, more robust conversations, and specific processes must be developed" ([Schuelke-Leech et al 2018:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SDAMYXIW?page=5))
