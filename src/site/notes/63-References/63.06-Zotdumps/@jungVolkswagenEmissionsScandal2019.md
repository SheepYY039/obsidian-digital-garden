# The Volkswagen Emissions Scandal and Its Aftermath

## Abstract

The discovery in 2015 that car maker Volkswagen (VW) had installed “defeat devices” into its diesel engines to lower emissions during testing exposed a corporate scandal and resulted in a 40% drop in the company's share price in 2 weeks. Although industry analysts questioned whether VW would survive the fallout, its sales quickly rebounded, and in 2017 the firm was the world's largest auto manufacturer. Although this unexpected surge led some to say that the scandal had blown over, there are indicators that VW has not yet fully recovered from the affair, and several issues stemming from it remain to be resolved. An examination of several reports issued as the crisis unfolded highlights the impact on VW and offers lessons for the firm's leaders and public policy makers.
