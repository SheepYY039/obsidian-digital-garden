# The Engineering of Volkswagen’s Aggressive Ambition

## Abstract

WOLFSBURG, Germany — All cars at the headquarters should, according to the rules, be parked facing the same way. The firm is controlled by a tight-knit troika of a billionaire family (Ferdinand Porsche’s descendants), a German state government (Lower Saxony) and powerful labor unions. The corporate jet is not just any jet, but a full-size Airbus. Volkswagen, by any standards, has an unusual corporate culture.

## Note

VW has blamed a small group of engineers for the misconduct, and has said that members of its management board did not know of the decade-long deception.

VW said this month that 50 potential whistle-blowers had come forward, hinting at wider knowledge of the cheating.

Arndt Ellinghorst, a former Volkswagen management trainee, said he witnessed an episode where technicians were showing Mr. Winterkorn the infotainment system on a luxury Phaeton, which was in development at the time before going on sale in 2002. Mr. Winterkorn, he said, mistakenly thought the push-button console was a touch screen, and became critical when it did not respond. When the technicians explained, he said, Mr. Winterkorn accused them of treating him like he was stupid.

Mr. Ellinghorst, now an automotive industry analyst at Evercore ISI, an investment advisory firm, said he decided not to stay at Volkswagen in part because of its management style. “VW had this special culture,” he said. “It was like North Korea without labor camps,” he added, quoting a well known description of the company by Der Spiegel magazine. “You have to obey.”

She described a hard-charging culture in which highly educated and motivated engineers competed for approval and promotion. The engineer, Emanuela Montefrancesco, said: “Here at Volkswagen in the last few years, we have forgotten to say, ‘I won’t do this. I cannot. I am sorry.’ ”
