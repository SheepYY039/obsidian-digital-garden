# How Does Collaborative Cheating Emerge? A Case Study of the Volkswagen Emissions Scandal

## Abstract

Since 2014, Volkswagen (VW) has been enthralled in a reputation-tarnishing cheating scandal that has raised questions regarding how collaborative cheating unfolds in organizational settings. While the behavioral ethics literature provides some insights, this literature is largely confined to individual decision makers and so little work examining how collaborative cheating emerges has been done. Therefore, with this case study, we draw on various data sources (e.g., court case summaries, investigative reporting, technical reports, popular press outlets, and publically available employee interviews) and use case study methodology (i.e., grounded theory, open-systems diagnostics) to construct a process model that explains how collaborative cheating emerges in organizational settings. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

"Such excess pollution was predicted to cause approximately 59 premature deaths, 31 cases of chronic bronchitis, 34 hospital admissions, 120,000 days of restricted activity—including lost work days—210,000 days with lower-respiratory problems and 33,000 days with increased use of asthma inhalers. The overall cost burden would be approximately $450 million" ([Castille and Fultz 2018:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=2))

"In crafting our timeline, it quickly became apparent that the behaviour occurring at VW was not an isolated, one-time event. Rather, it was an ongoing effort reflecting many decision points faced by multiple VW employees from various departments and hierarchical levels who were making unique contributions over a substantial period of time" ([Castille and Fultz 2018:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=3))

"Independently, in 1999, Audi engineers created software that could defeat European emissions testing." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"In 2006, following threats from VW AG's CEO (executive A) who had a reputation for firing engineers who did not meet his exacting standards -that employees would lose their jobs if VW could not sell diesel engines in the U.S, two department heads (_Manager E_ , Head of VW’s Engine Development After-treatment Department and _Manager D_, Head of Diesel Engine Development for VW), knowing both that their engines exceeded emissions standards and how U.S. regulators would test VW vehicles, led the team that would create the defeat device." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"During this time, a VW employee acquired software from _Company A_ (an automotive engineering company specializing in software, electronics, and technology which VW owned 50% of) to create the EA189 engine that would be capable of defeating emissions testing." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"[Audi] suggests that the VW leadership developed a pervasive culture that encouraged the use of unethical means to attain market superiority" ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"Moving closer to the creation of the defeat device, our data suggest that authority or bullying from leadership along with normative pressures can drive individuals within a group to decide to contribute to a collaborative cheating effort." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"Additionally , while a wealth of literature exists on unethical or destructive leadership [23,29]," ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"Our data suggest that such leaders might also cultivate a collective bottom-line mentality among employees, resulting in collaborative ventures that produce unethical solutions." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"VW employees presented their newly developed engine to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) in order to obtain approval for marketing diesel vehicles to the U.S. In this meeting, _Manager E_ and _VW employees_ knowingly omitted and concealed information regarding the defeat device's existence." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"Later in 2007, _Manager E_ , _Manager D_ , and _VW emplyees_ meet to discuss which team is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the EA189 engine satisfies emissions standards. The meeting ends with _Manager E_ arguing to continue developing the EA189 engine with the defeat device and _Manager E_ formally authorizing the deployment of the engine." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"_Engineer B_, who worked on the team that developed the defeat device, later moves to U.S. to oversee testing of the new diesel vehicles" ([Castille and Fultz 2018:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=4))

"After receiving a letter from VW engineers suggesting that the defeat device stresses the exhaust system resulting in hardware failures, _Supervisor A_ and _Manager B, the head of engine development for the VW Passenger Cards brand_, instruct the engineers to destroy said letter." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=5))

"_VW engineers_ expressed concerns to management, particularly Manager B , about this software update" ([Castille and Fultz 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=5))

"The evidence emerging from this stage helps explain how the number of employees contributing to a collaborative cheating effort increased overtime – what we call an enveloping effect." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=5))

"At this point in the timeline, many individuals had already contributed to the effort (or were still doing so), so for individuals uncovering the existence of the defeat device, a cost-benefit judgment had to be made in regard to contributing to the device's implementation. The costs of failing to contribute (e.g., losing one's job, threatening one's peers' or superiors' livelihoods) were probably seen as excessively high." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=5))

"Eventually, an unnamed employee (a VW executive in the U.S. responsible for emissions compliance) neglected executive instruction to keep the device concealed and explained the device's existence to CARB, forcing VW executives to formally reveal the software and bringing the device’s concealment to an abrupt end." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=5))

"He also argued that organizational deceptions can affect employee turnover by encouraging employees who are uncomfortable with engaging in unethical behaviour to leave while those who are comfortable with dishonesty remain, further increasing the probability of dishonest acts." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

"VW leadership appeared to have turned a large number of employees who were initially uncomfortable contributing to the defeat device's ongoing use into contributors to the collaborative cheating effort." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

": they cultivate a climate of fear where employees' job security is threatened [36] and a collective bottom line mentality where employees' self-interests become aligned [34], motivating them to pursue strategies that would secure their short-term self-interests." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

"If a culture is ethically permissive, then unethical solutions may already exist, helping the collaborative cheating effort to emerge." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

"As the collaborative cheating effort unfolds over time, more actors become aware and, upon appraising the costliness of failing to contribute, join the collective cheating effort." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

"Hence, rather than leaving because they have been encouraged to violate their values, they remain. With a greater number of individuals contributing to the collective cheating effort(s), the organization's use of deceptive tactics increase (e.g., fraudulent products or services), raising the risk that falsehoods will be found out, resulting in organizational decline." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

"Another framework, grounded in social norms, suggests that the social context informs such decision-making [8,37-40]. By explaining collaborative cheating behaviour as an outcome of a cost benefit analysis that is informed by normative considerations [31], our study highlights a deep relationship between these two perspectives." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

"As the number of individual contributors increases, (1) the variety of expertise within the collective effort increases, raising the group's ability to refine and sustain further collaborative cheating and (2) more people become at risk of reaching their threshold for joining the collective effort. Those who contribute become invested in sustaining the collaborative cheating effort." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

"Once organizational leaders commit to an unethical action, escalation of further commitments 6 Page 99" ([Castille and Fultz 2018:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=6))

"will likely follow, generating collective moral disengagement, and enveloping others, leading to ever riskierbehaviourr (e.g., targeting regulations and regulators themselves)." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=7))

". Indeed, at least one VW executive denied in an interview that the VW scandal concerned a breach of ethics." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=7))

"To address quality issues, we relied primarily on legal documents to craft our narrative." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=7))

"Therefore, our model should be viewed as preliminary and will be updated as more facts emerge." ([Castille and Fultz 2018:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FC7I2LBK?page=7))
