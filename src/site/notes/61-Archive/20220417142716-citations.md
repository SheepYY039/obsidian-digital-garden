2. Support it with a <mark class="hltr-orange">citation</mark>
3. <mark class="hltr-yellow">Explain or interpret</mark> the citation for your reader

### Example

> <mark class="hltr-red">If an arguement is logical it is possible to argue for it.</mark><mark class="hltr-orange"> As Toulin (2003) remarks: "Logic is concerned with the soundness of the claims we makewith the solidity of the grounds we produce to support them, the firmness of the backing we provide for themor to change the metaphor, with the sort of case we present in defence of our claims." </mark> <mark class="hltr-yellow">So if you find it hard to provide good backing and sound support for your own arguments or if you find it hard to detect this backing and support in the arguments of others, the arguments are probably not logical and therefore weak. </mark>

## Example of Citations

### Initial Text

> Logic is concerned with the soundness of the claims we make - with the solidity of the grounds we produce to support them, the firmness of the backing we provide for them - or, to change the metaphor, with the sort of case we present in defence of our claims.

### Summarizing

- Example of a [Summary](20220417142801-summary.md)

> Toulmin (2003) notes that strong claims in arguments have strong backing and support and can be defended by making a case for them.

### Paraphrasing

- Example of a [Paraphrase](20220417142949-paraphrase.md)

> If an argument is logical it will be well supported and it will be possible to make a case for it (Toulmin, 2003).

### Quoting

- Example of a [quotation](20220417143052-quotation.md)

> With Toulmin (2003), I would argue that "logic is concerned with the soundness of the claims we make" and "with the sort of case we present in defence of our claims" (p.15).
