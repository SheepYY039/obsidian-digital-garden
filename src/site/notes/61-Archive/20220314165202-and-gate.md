## Creation of AND Gate Using Diodes

This is AND Gate using [[61-Archive/20220421150047-npn-transistor|NPN]] in **series**

- When $V_A$ and $V_B$ is connected to GND,
- Multimeter -ve is always to $V_{out}$
- When $V_{B}=5$ and $V_{A}=0$, then D2 will be off and D1
  - since parallel, D1 will still work
- When both $5$, both [[61-Archive/20220221170726-diode|diode]] off because no potential difference, so $V_{out}$ is $5V$ from the input
