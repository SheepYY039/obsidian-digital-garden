# Circuit Analysis

> [!word] Circuit Analysis
> Circuit analysis is the process of finding the [voltage](20220318120826-voltage.md) accross and [current](20220408104411-current.md) through each component of the network.

## Methods for Circuit Analysis

1. [Kirchhoff's Voltage Law](62-Encyclopedic/20220221122800-kirchhoffs-voltage-law.md)
2. [Kirchhoff's Current Law](62-Encyclopedic/20220221115900-kirchhoffs-current-law.md)

> [!note]
> When using [Kirchhoff's Laws](20220411113431-kirchhoff's-laws.md), we need to deci
>
> 1. which [Loops, Nodes, Branches](20220411113559-components-of-a-circuit.md) to use
> 2. The direction of [Current Flow](20220408110703-current-flow.md) through each [loop, node, branch](20220411113559-components-of-a-circuit.md)
