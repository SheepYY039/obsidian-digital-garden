# Circuit Simplification

To try and simplify the circuit by reducing a circuit to a single voltage source and an equivalent [Resistance](20220408115601-resistance.md).

[Kirchoff's Laws](20220411113431-kirchhoff's-laws.md) are used to analyze a circuit if they are **too complex** to be simplified using _series-parallel techniques_ (See [Resistors in Parallel](20220408133318-resistors-in-parallel.md) and [Resistor in Series](20220411105450-resistor-in-series.md)).
