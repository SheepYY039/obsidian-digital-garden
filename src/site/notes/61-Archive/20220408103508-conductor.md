# Conductor

Conductors allow charge to flow easily through the free movement of [electrons](20220411123012-electron). These [electrons](20220411123012-electron) are free to move from one [atom](atom) to another.

Conductors have **low [resistance](Resistance)**.

If charge is transferred to the object at a given location, that charge is quickly distributed accross the entire surface of the object, which is a result of electron movement.

If touching another object, a conductor will also transfer charge to it.
