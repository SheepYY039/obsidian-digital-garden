# Conservation of Energy

Conservation of energy only applies to **closed systems**.

Energy can be in, or converted from/to, any forms, but the total energy in the closed system is conserved.

## Example

A ball falling form the leaning Tower of Pisa get its [Kinetic Energy](Kinetic-Energy) from [Potential Energy](Potential-Energy).
