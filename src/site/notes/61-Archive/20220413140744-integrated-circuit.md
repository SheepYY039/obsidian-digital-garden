# Integrated Circuit

> [!word] Integrated Circuit
> An integrated circuit is a tiny fingernail sized chip, containing several billion transistors and electric components, such as capacitors, resistors, diodes, etc.

- Each IC has a **U-Shape** mark to indicate its _top_
- The pins are labelled starting from 1 from the **top left** corner going **downwards** and from **bottom right** corner back **upwards**. Just like a _U-shape_
