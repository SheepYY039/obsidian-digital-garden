# Dynamic Programming Algorithms

> [[61-Archive/20220319090756-dynamic-programming-algorithms#Dynamic-Programming-Algorithms|!word]]
> A dynamic programming algorithm remembers past results and uses them to find new results
>
> - Dynamic programming is generally used for optimization problems
>   - Multiple solutions exist, need to find the "best" one
>   - Requires "optimal structure" and "overlapping subproblems"
>     - **Optimal Structure** -- Optimal solution contains optimal solution to subproblems
>     - **Overlapping subproblems** -- Solutions to subproblems can be stored and reused in a bottom-up fashion

> [!note]
> This differs from [[61-Archive/20220319085809-divide-and-conquer-algorithms|Divide and Conquer algorithms]], where subproblems generally need not overlap
