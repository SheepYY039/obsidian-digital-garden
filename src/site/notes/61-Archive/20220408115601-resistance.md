# Resistance

Resistance is the ability of a [conducting material](20220408103057-conductors-and-insulators.md) to resist the flow of [charge](Charge) or [current](20220408104411-current.md).

unit:: ohm ($\Omega$)

<!--SR:!2022-04-26,4,270-->

symbol:: R

<!--SR:!2022-04-26,4,270-->

All loads have resistance, including wires.
[Resistors](20220221120700-resistor.md) are used to add resistance to a circuit.

## Calculations

- [Calculate Resistance of Wire](20220408120147-calculate-resistance-of-wire.md)

## Purposes of Resistance

### Resistance Can Be Added to Avoid Large Current

- An [ideal wire](Ideal-Wire) should be an [ideal conductor](Ideal-Conductor), which means **_no resistance_**.
- An [ideal insulator](Ideal-Insulator) should have **_Infinite resistance_**.
- Real components should have **_finite amount of resistance_**
