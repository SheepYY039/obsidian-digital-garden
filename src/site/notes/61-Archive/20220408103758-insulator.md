# Insulator

Insulators **do not allow** charge to move easily.

Insulators have **high [resistance](Resistance)**.

If charge is transferred to an insulator, <mark class="hltr-yellow">the excess charge will remain at the initial location of charging</mark> .

Charge is <mark class="hltr-yellow">seldom distributed evenly</mark> across the surface of an insulator.
