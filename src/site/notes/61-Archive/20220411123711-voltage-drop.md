# Voltage Drop

> [!word] Voltage Drop
> Voltage Drop is defined as the amount of [Voltage](20220318120826-voltage.md) loss that occurs through all or part of a circuit due to impedance.

## Direction of Voltage Drop

Just like [Current Flow](20220408110703-current-flow.md), voltage drop also has a direction.

For a wire between two [nodes](20220411113840-node.md) ($A$ and $B$):

- $V_{AB}=-V_{BA}$

## Analogy

> [!example]
> A common analogy used to explain [Voltage](20220318120826-voltage.md), [Current](20220408104411-current.md) and [Voltage Drop](20220411123711-voltage-drop.md) is a garden hose.

> - [Voltage](20220318120826-voltage.md) is analogous to the _water pressure_ supplied to the hose.
> - [Current](20220408104411-current.md) is analogous to the _water flowing through_ the hose.
> - And the inherent [Resistance](20220408115601-resistance.md) of the hose is _determined by the type and size of the hose_ - just like the type and size of an [electrical wire](electrical-wire) determines its resistance.
