## Example of a Concluding Paragraph

> In conclusion, a standardized writing system might seem desirable to enable everyone to communicate more effectively, but this is undesirable and impractical. A standardized writing system would inevitably diminish the stock of human knowledge and culture contained within the world's interesting and admired diverse writing systems because standardization would take precendence over uniquness. A standardized writing system would furthermore be problematic because of the impracticality of re-educating citizens to use a new writing system and the attendant political problems associated with such a re-education programme. Writing systems are as creative, diverse and essential as the cultures that have produced them and humans should therefore celebrate the diversity of writing systems in the world today.
