# Energy

symbol:: E

<!--SR:!2022-04-26,4,270-->

unit:: Joules (J) or electron-volts (eV)

<!--SR:!2022-04-23,1,230-->

There are different forms of energy: [[Mechanical-Energy|Mechanical Energy]], [[Thermal-Energy|Thermal Energy]], [[61-Archive/20220408132112-electrical-energy|20220408132112 Electrical Energy.md]], [[Chemical-Energy|Chemical Energy]], etc.

When there is [[61-Archive/20220408110703-current-flow|Current Flow]], a +ve charge ($q$) gains energy when it moves from a point at lower [[61-Archive/20220318120826-voltage|Voltage]] to a point with higher [[61-Archive/20220318120826-voltage|Voltage]] .

$$
E = q\times V
$$

The energy transferred by the amount of electric charge by a [[61-Archive/20220318120826-voltage|Potential Difference]] of $V$ volts.

## Understanding

$V=\frac{E}{q}$ means that the [[61-Archive/20220318120826-voltage|Voltage]] difference between two points is the energy gained by each charge.

- If [[61-Archive/20220408130745-conservation-of-energy|energy is conserved]], then the total energy in a system will remain the same.
