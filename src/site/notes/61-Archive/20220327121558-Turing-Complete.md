# Turing Complete

- Can perform any calculations

## History

[[Alan Turing|Alan Turing]] created a machine that can

1. take a program
2. run a program
3. show result

But he had to create **different machines** for **different programs**

## Anything That is Turing Complete

1. Can make decisions
2. Can run Forever
3. Can use infinite memory
   1. Languages like Java will terminate once it uses 4GB of memory
   2. Java will not be able to do arbitrary computations that never terminates
4. Has random access memory
   1. Can read string **once**
   2. Use memory to `push` and `pop` on its own and make decisions
   3. E.g. A turing machine can use its random access memory to track `()`'s and `[See [theory - What is Turing Complete? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1610655](1610655))
5. Simulate any other turing machines
   1. E.g. A language that can was forbidden from implementing a Python interpreter is not Turing complete (See [theory - What is Turing Complete? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1610655))
