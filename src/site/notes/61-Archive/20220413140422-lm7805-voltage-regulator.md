# LM7805 Voltage Regulator

> [!word] LM7805
> LM7805 is an [integrated circuit](20220413140744-integrated-circuit.md) that works as a [voltage regulator](20220413141443-voltage-regulator.md).
>
> - High Voltage is passed in through $V_{in}$
> - Terminal 2 $GND$ is conected to the ground
> - The regulated output with a _lower voltage_ is output to $V_{out}$ for the remaining circuit.
