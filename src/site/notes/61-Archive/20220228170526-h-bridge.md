# H-Bridge

An H-Bridge is a simple circuit structure which makes use of _4 [[61-Archive/20220225122049-transistor|transistors]]_ to control a [[61-Archive/20220418094635-motor|motor]] to go **backwards** or **fowards**.

The direction of motion is dependent on how the positive (-ve) and negative (-ve) terminals are connected.

| S4 (PNP) | Q3 (NPN) | Q2 (PNP) | Q1 (NPN) | Motor              |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| 5V       | 5V       | 0V (GND) | 0V (GND) | One Direction      |
| 0V (GND) | 0V (GND) | 5V       | 5V       | Opposite Direction |

- [[20220418133554-Brushed-Motor|Brushed motors]] (The [[61-Archive/20220418094635-motor|motor]] type used in the center) usually require very high current to drive
  - Operate transistors in [[61-Archive/20220415142132-transistor-operation-modes#Saturation-Mode|20220415142132-Transistor-Operation-Modes#Saturation-Mode]] to get **maximum collector current**

## Simplify the Control

An [[61-Archive/20220314165003-not-gate|inverter]] can be included to simplify the control of the 4 transistors.
