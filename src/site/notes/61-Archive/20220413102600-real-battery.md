# Real [Battery](20220221170305-battery.md)

Real batteries are those we see in real life, they have [internal resistance](Internal-Resistance) within them. However, we don't like internal resistances, so they should be avoided, which is the case for [ideal batteries](20220413103516-ideal-battery.md).

A [battery](20220221170305-battery.md) can be modelled as an emf $\varepsilon$ and an [internal resistance](Internal-Resistance) of $r$.

Since [voltage](20220318120826-voltage.md) is defined by the difference in [electric potential](Electric-Potential) between its +ve and -ve terminals. For a [battery](20220221170305-battery.md), its "original" voltage is $\varepsilon$, but that decreases by $Ir$ volts as it passes its internal resistor, therefore, the "Actual" voltage is $V=\varepsilon-Ir$ .

If a [battery](20220221170305-battery.md) has a _large [internal resistance](Internal-Resistance)_, then it may lead to [Short Circuit](20220408134254-short-circuit.md).
