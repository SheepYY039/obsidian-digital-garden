# DC Motor

> [!word] DC Motor
> A DC motor is a [DC Source](20220221163300-dc-source.md) which is powered by direct current.

There are different DC Motors:

1. [Brushed Motor](20220418133554-Brushed-Motor)
2. Brushless Motor
3. Stepper Motor

> [!note]
> We can control the [motor](20220418094635-motor.md):
>
> - **Direction**: by reversing the [current](20220408104411-current.md) direction flowing into the [motor](20220418094635-motor.md)
> - **Rotation Speed**: by regulating the [voltage](20220318120826-voltage.md) across the [motor](20220418094635-motor.md) terminals

> [!warning] Disadvantages
>
> 1.  Efficiency - _[Energy](20220223192810-energy.md) is wasted as heat_ in the variable [resistor](20220221120700-resistor.md) particularly at low speeds.
> 2.  It is difficult to control the speed _precisely_
> 3.  Need mechanical motion to turn the [resistor](20220221120700-resistor.md) so it is _not computer friendly_
>
> Solution:
> [Pulse Voltage](20220307163549-Pulse-Voltage) can be used to solve the above problems.

## [Pulse Voltage](20220307163549-Pulse-Voltage) with DC [Motor](20220418094635-motor.md)

The **rotation speed** of a DC [Motor](20220418094635-motor.md) is **directly proportional** with the **[average voltage](20220420142646-average-voltage.md)** value on its terminals

- Therefore the speed of the motor can be controlled by adjusting the pulse width (**duty cycle**)
