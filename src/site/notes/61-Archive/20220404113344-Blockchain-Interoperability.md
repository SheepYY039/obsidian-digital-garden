# Blockchain Interoperability

> [!word] Blockchain Interoperability
> Can be understood as the communication mechanism between two or more blockchains.
>
> - The ability to see, access, and share information accross different blockchains or [blockchain](61-Atomic/20220327115103-blockchain.md) networks

- Allow Different blockchain networks to exchange data between one another and to move digital assets between network's chains.

## Benefits of Blockchain Interoperability

1. **Cross-chain transactions**
2. **Ease [Blockchain](61-Atomic/20220327115103-blockchain.md) Transasctions**
3. **Multi-token transactions**
4. Makes the [blockchain](61-Atomic/20220327115103-blockchain.md) process easier and more transparent
5. Implementation of blockchain interoperability will incresase the communication rate of their blockchains
6. Ease Inter-blockchain communication

## Why is Blockchain Interoperability Important?

- We hope to have smooth digital transfer or sharing
- Ensure more freedom between different blockchains
