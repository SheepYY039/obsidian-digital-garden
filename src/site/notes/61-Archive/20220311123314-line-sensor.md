> A line sensor includes an **infrared [[19700101080000-Light-Emitting-Diode|LED]]** and an infrared **[[61-Archive/20220311121416-light-sensor|Light Sensor]]**

> - The [[19700101080000-Light-Emitting-Diode|LED]] illuminates the surface
> - The [[61-Archive/20220311121416-light-sensor|light sensor]] picks up the infrared radiation

- A bright surface will reflect more light than a dark surface. Therefore, a **dark line in a bright surface** or a **bright line in a dark surface** can be detected

## Application on Robot Car

- Your lab sensor (the bright sensing circuit) gives an **output [[61-Archive/20220318120826-voltage|voltage]]** to distinguish a **bright** or **dark** surface

### Another Sensor - Determine Direction

- A single Sensor (Bumper Sensor) can allow the robot to follow a straight line
- Two Sensor (Left and right sensor) will allow the robot to know how to follow a line
  - If left sensor touches, swing right
  - If right sensor touches, swing left
  - The line will always stay between the two line sensors
